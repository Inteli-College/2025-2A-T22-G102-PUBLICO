## 📌 About the Project

St. Paul’s School is a leading academic institution that values excellence and innovation. However, its current reporting process is manual, fragmented, and time-consuming, limiting the ability to generate valuable insights.
The project’s vision is to deliver a centralized and automated data environment, integrated with Power BI, that streamlines reporting and empowers teachers, coordinators, and leadership with reliable indicators.

### Project Goals
**For the Institution:**
Automate data collection and transformation from multiple academic sources.
Provide strategic insights for decision-making.

**For the Users:**
Teachers: quick access to student and class-level performance.
Coordinators: consolidated views for grades, subjects, and periods.
Leadership: strategic reports for institutional planning.
